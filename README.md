# HutsonWeiss2022

This repository contains all information needed to replicate the simulations used in Hutson and Weiss (2023). The simulations were conducted using version 19 of Cloud Model Version 1 (CM1), which is maintained by Dr. George Bryan's and is available on the website https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/.  

"ruc_pert_soundings" - this folder contains both the original May 24, 2011 Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) El Reno, Oklahoma proximity sounding, and the 50 randomly perturbed soundings used to create the CM1 ensemble. These sounding files are text files formatted for use as the "input_sounding" file to be imported directly by CM1. Each sounding file has a number (e.g., ruc_perturbed_1; except for ruc_control) that corresponds with the member number used in Hutson and Weiss 2023 Fig. 4 (ruc_control corresponds with member number 0, or the control member).
